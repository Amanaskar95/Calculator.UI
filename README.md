# Calculator.UI


This Java program is a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI).

## User Interface Setup:
The program creates a window where you can see the calculator.
Inside the window, there are buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, and other functions.
## Button Actions:
Each button on the calculator has a function.
For example, when you click the "7" button, it adds the number 7 to the display.
Similarly, clicking the "+" button indicates you want to add two numbers together.
## Display:
There's a text area at the top of the calculator that shows the numbers and operations you've entered.
It's like the paper tape of an old-fashioned calculator, but here you see the numbers and operations as you type them.
## Functionality:
The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It can also handle decimal numbers (like 5.7) and other functions like square root and changing a number's sign (positive or negative).
## Calculations:
When you click the "=" button, the calculator performs the calculation based on the numbers and operations you've entered.
It shows the result in the display area.
## Clearing and Errors:
There's a "C" button that clears the display, allowing you to start a new calculation.
If you make a mistake or enter something the calculator doesn't understand, it tries to handle the error gracefully without crashing.
## User Interface Design:
The calculator's appearance and layout are designed to be user-friendly.
It uses a modern look and feel (Nimbus) provided by Java's Swing library.

Overall, this calculator is like having a simple electronic calculator on your computer screen. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic calculations quickly and easily using a familiar interface.
